            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Calorie calculators are widely used tools in nutrition, fitness, and healthcare to estimate daily energy requirements. 
                    These tools help individuals manage their weight, plan diets, and optimize energy intake. The accuracy and reliability 
                    of a calorie calculator depend on the mathematical and statistical models underpinning its design.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Purpose of a Calorie Calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    The primary purpose of a calorie calculator is to estimate the number of calories an individual needs to consume 
                    daily to maintain, lose, or gain weight. This estimation is based on several factors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):</strong> The energy expended at rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):</strong> BMR adjusted by physical activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Weight maintenance, gain, or loss.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Components of the Calorie Calculation</h3>
                
                <h4>3.1 Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h4>
                <p>
                    BMR represents the number of calories required to maintain vital body functions (like breathing and heartbeat) at rest. 
                    It is the foundation for calorie estimation and is calculated using regression-based formulas.
                </p>

                <h4>3.2 Physical Activity Level</h4>
                <p>
                    Calorie calculators apply an activity multiplier to the BMR to estimate TDEE. These multipliers are categorized 
                    based on general physical activity and are derived from empirical studies.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Statistical Model Used: Multiple Linear Regression</h3>
                <p>
                    Most calorie calculators are built on multiple linear regression models developed from metabolic research. 
                    This statistical model estimates the relationship between one dependent variable (calories) and multiple 
                    independent variables (age, weight, height, sex, and activity level).
                </p>

                <h4>4.1 Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (Regression Model)</h4>
                <p>This equation is based on linear regression analysis of data from healthy adults:</p>
                <div class="alert alert-light">
                    <code>BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) - 5 × age (years) + s</code><br>
                    Where:<br>
                    • s = +5 for males<br>
                    • s = -161 for females
                </div>
                <p>
                    This equation was derived using regression modeling of calorimetry data, making it a predictive statistical model.
                </p>

                <h4>4.2 Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)</h4>
                <div class="alert alert-light">
                    <code>TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Activity factors are categorical variables based on physical activity levels, applied as multipliers 
                    (e.g., 1.2 for sedentary, 1.55 for moderate activity).
                </p>

                <h3>5. Data Sources and Model Development</h3>
                <p>
                    These models were created from large-scale studies measuring actual energy expenditure using techniques 
                    like indirect calorimetry. Researchers performed regression analyses to identify the most predictive 
                    variables and derive coefficients for use in formulae.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Limitations of the Model</h3>
                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    <ul class="mb-0">
                        <li><strong>Based on averages:</strong> May not account for individual metabolic variation.</li>
                        <li>Activity factor estimates can be imprecise.</li>
                        <li>Does not include genetic, hormonal, or environmental factors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>7. Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Calorie calculators are practical tools built on robust statistical models, primarily multiple linear regression. 
                    By using demographic and physiological inputs, these calculators provide estimates of caloric needs, guiding 
                    individuals in nutrition planning. While not perfectly accurate, they serve as a scientifically grounded starting 
                    point for personal health management.
